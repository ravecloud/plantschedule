Reasons for dynamic scheduling
- Unforseen events (machien breakdowns, rush orders, material shortage, yield)
- maintain continuous production
- 

Why do we use simulation models?

What is the overall question?

Startegy
- Minimize changes between initial and rescheduled schedule
-- incur additional setup and transportation cost (is this really the case?)

Approximate methods
- medium-sized problems are nearly impossible to find exact solutions
- use metaheuristics to solve larger problems within acceptable time
- trade-off between longer computation times and deteriorating solution quality
-- (our methods aims to overcome the trade-off between longer computation times and solution quality)


[A survey of job shop scheduling problem: the types and models]
Trade-off Between Computation Time and Solution Quality:
    Computation Times: Metaheuristic methods may take significantly longer to find solutions as problem size grows, especially when trying to find high-quality or optimal solutions.
    Solution Quality: Alternatively, if the computation time is restricted (e.g., due to practical constraints), the quality of the solutions generated may deteriorate. This happens because larger problem sizes typically require more exploration and evaluation to find good solutions, and insufficient computational resources can lead to suboptimal results.

Scaling Challenges:
    For smaller problems, metaheuristics often perform well, balancing efficiency and effectiveness.
    As problem sizes increase, the algorithms might struggle to maintain both speed and quality due to the complexity and search space explosion that typically accompanies larger problems.

-> To use metaheurisics is advantageous but also encounters limitations due to exponentially growing computation times

Our approach tries to overcome these trade-offs by...
1. Conservation of the population and individual solution quality 
2. Warm-start of the EA
3.

Simulation optimization applied to production scheduling in the era of industry 4.0: A review and future roadmap

Production scheduling (PS):
- impacts tactical and strategical levels of decision making
- efficiency towards the whole supply chain

Simulation Optimization (SO):
- a growing Decision support tool (DST)

SOAP - Simulation Optimization Applied to Production Scheduling
- Real-time and efficient SO-based DST for PS modules

Performance of a manufacturing system
- produce products competitively and sustainably

Manufacturing system (hierarchy)
- Network of manufacturing plants
- workstations inside the manufacturing plants
- production steps within each workstation

Strategic decisions
- macro-level buisness (long-term planning horizon)
- between manufacturing plants

Tactical decisions
- decisions at the manufacturing plant level
- mid-term planning horizon

Operational decisions
- production plant (workstation plans, order scheduling)
- short term

-> Decisions are different but hierarchicalnaligend
